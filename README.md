# Nemesis

> Nemesis is an emulator that I use as a POC to reverse engineer the Dofus Retro game in order to better understand how it works

> It is completely free and usable, however I do not provide any debug or support, a changelog will be available at the end of the development indicating the novelties integrated into the latter.
